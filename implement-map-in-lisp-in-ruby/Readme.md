Description
===========

Was talking to one of the craftsmen at [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com/), who was saying
that it was talking about implementing map in his own lisp. Figured I'd give it a shot.
Cheated a bit in that I built it mostly out of Ruby, but the map function is all within the paradigm.
