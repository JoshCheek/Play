Description
===========

So no one ever told me about ansi escape sequences! I found out about them incidentally by investigating "How did he do that?" when watching some of [mamememo](http://mamememo.blogspot.com/)'s quines. So, to play with them and see what I could do, I wrote this lib.

Check out the [example](http://github.com/JoshCheek/Play/tree/master/clf/example.rb), which animates a guy running across the screen.
