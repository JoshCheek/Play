[Quines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29) in various programming languages.

quine.c    
-------
Uses trick where you can specify which argument a parameter in the string should pull from in order to reuse printf arguments to construct a template within the C program.

quine.cat
---------
Wasn't actually my idea, but was very smart, so I wanted to put it here. Got it from [this post](http://www.skorks.com/2010/03/an-interview-question-that-prints-out-its-own-source-code-in-ruby/#comment-4031)

quine1.rb
---------
Same as the C version, but for Ruby

quine2.rb
---------
This is possibly considered cheating :P

**This code is unmaintained.** 

_If you do something interesting with it, let me know so I can be happy._
