Reflection
==========

Overall, I enjoyed them. They reminded me of when I used to work on 
[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems. I'll admit I was
a little like "meh" when I solved the second one. The insight that
every other char is an edge renders my BinTree pointless. But I kept
it in there since that's how I got that insight. (I always hated that
on Project Euler, too, when I would write some code that I would be
really proud of, and through the process of writing it and refining
it, I'd finally realize that all of it was irrelevant due to an
insight like this).

I also didn't like on the second one how they called it a binary tree.
I thought of a couple examples that proved the problem couldn't be
solved, and walked away. The next day in the shower, I was thinking
about what implicit assumptions they must have made that allowed that
problem to make sense, and I realized they must have meant for it to
be balanced, causing each non-leaf to have exactly 2 children.

I enjoyed the third problem, but suspect my solution isn't the
algorithmically genius way of doing things. I thought about looking
up the right algorithm for it, but whatever. I do these to challenge
myself, looking up and then implementing the best solution is what
I'd do if this were for something in production. But that isn't what
this is, this is just exercises to challenge myself, so I decided to
solve it myself.
